# Data-Structures-Algorithms

ABC University’s advisors required a program to read a csv file and allow users to sort, print, and search those courses. Users also required access to the prerequisites necessary for a particular course. 

My approach was to consider the number of elements and the user requirements. I discerned which algorithms would be required to accomplish the user’s objectives and how those algorithms would be affected by various data structures. My plan was initially developed by writing pseudocode, and then evolved into the code base. I tested and retested the source code with different input in varying formats until it met the client's criteria. 

Additional resources such as Stack Overflow, YouTube, and the C++ documentation assisted me most when I was uncertain of how to proceed.  

My work on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs. It enabled me to understand and consider the functional differences between data structures. These two projects emphasize how crucial this decision can be, and how the data structure will affect the application’s overall outcome. Programming changes, runtime, space complexity, and other factors influence this choice.  

It has also shown me the importance of maintainability and adaptability.During the software development lifecycle, many changes may occur. Software engineering should not be constrained or delayed due to poorly chosen data structures. Also, the next team of developers should receive readable code that they can refactor more easily because the previous teams’ work was in alignment with industry best practices.
